Cornered Game

Object: Win more squares than your opponent. 

Connect two dots with a line. The player who closes a square by drawing the last side of a square wins that square. The square is then marked with that players first initial of their name. The player who just won the square gets to go again.

The game ends when all squares have been occupied. The player with the most squares wins.

Pseudocode: 

Establish a 5x5 board of dots connected by greyed out lines to form a grid of 5x5 boxes. 

When a line is selected change the border color of the border. 
When the last border of a square is drawn put the first initial of the player in the square and allow another turn.
